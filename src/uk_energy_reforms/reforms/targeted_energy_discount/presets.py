"""Named parameter settings for the targeted energy discount.

Amounts are RF's published averages for a 2 billion GBP scheme ("Billing me softly",
p. 9): a flat 175 GBP for households whose highest individual income is below
24,000 GBP, or a tiered 220 GBP below 18,000 GBP and 85 GBP from 18,000 GBP to
24,000 GBP. RF's scheme is a unit-rate discount, so these are averages; the analysis
layer can turn them into unit rates (``calibrate.unit_rate_changes``) or rescale them to
a budget (``calibrate.budget_changes``).
