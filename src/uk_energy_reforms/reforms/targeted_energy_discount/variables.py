"""Variables for the targeted energy discount.

The discount is household-level: energy is billed per meter, which usually means per
household (RF, "Billing me softly", p. 6). A household is eligible if it receives a
passporting benefit or if its highest-income member passes the income test. Support
then follows a schedule by the household's assessed income.
